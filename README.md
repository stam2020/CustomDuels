## About The Project

I always believe that everything should be simple.
<br>
So when I discovered that so little generator servers exist, I thought to develop this plugin, and make generator servers accessible to everyone. 

Why you should use this plugin:
* Fast, efficient and powerful
* Very configurable and flexible


I hope that you will find this plugin useful!

### Built With

This plugin is built using
* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
* [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)




## Getting Started

To download the plugin, visit [SimpleGenerators](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/simplegenerators.94621/)

### Prerequisites

Requires the following plugins:
* [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault)
* Any economy plugin, such as [Essentials](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/)


## Usage

To define a new generator, under the generator field in the config add the rank of the generator, and under it the information. For example:
```yaml
1:
    name: "My First Generator!"
    lore: "The lore for your generator"
    block: "minecraft:cake"
    drop: "minecraft:candle"
    upgrade_price: 500
```
This will create a generator made of cake called "My First Generator!" with the lore "The lore for your generator" that generates candles, and costs 500 to upgrade.

To define a new sellable item, under the items field in the config add the id of the sellable item, and under it the information. For example:
```yaml
candle:
    sell_price: 20
```
This will make the candle item sell for 20.

To define a sellwand, under the sellwands field in the config, add any name you want for the sellwand, and under it the information. For example:
 
```yaml
x3SellWand:
    name: "My First Sellwand!"
    item: "minecraft:blaze_rod"
    multiplier: 3
```
This will create a blaze rod sellwand, called "My First Sellwand!", with a sell mutiplier of 3.

To change the frequency of the drops of the generators, change the drop_frequency field in the config. For example:
```yaml
drop_frequency: 100
```
Will make generators drop every 100 ticks, meaning 5 seconds.

If you want to require players to be on the server for their generators to work, set the field ```generate_offline``` to false. Be careful, turning it to true might cause alot of lag!
 
You can also limit the maximum amount of generators a player can place down, by giving them or their rank the permission node: ```SimpleGenerators.max_gen.NUMBER```. For example the permission node ```SimpleGenerators.max_gen.5``` will allow them to place down 5 generators.
 
To reload the config in-game, run:
```sh
/SimpleGenerators reload
```
